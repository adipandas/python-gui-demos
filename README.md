# python-gui-demos
This repo contains the basic demonstration of python gui
Programs are based on use of tkinter python module.
I have tried to show the use of various UI functionalities using tkinter python3.6

This should be helpful for someone who wants to develop the desktop app using python.
tkinter is amazingly simple and allow various UI designs.

For more details, refer the tkinter documentation https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter

I invite anyone interested to contribute.
